Easy Rider Bus Company database checker I made myself!

I've just been hired by a bus company that started actively using the Internet for business. Before I came, their database had been updated a few times by various employees with various levels of skill. My task is to find all the mistakes they made in the database. Good news: I had documentation, but bad news: it's incomplete. This promises to be quite an investigation!

My code is here: https://github.com/DataSamuraii/Easy-rider-bus-company/blob/master/Easy%20Rider%20Bus%20Company/task/easyrider/easyrider.py  <sub> sorry for the structure; it was defined by the course </sub>
